# Readme - Getting and Cleaning Data project 1

This repo contains a solution to the peer-reviewed assessment for the *Getting and Cleaning Data* course on Coursera, in which smartphone accelerometer data must be collected into a tidied set of data that could be used for further analysis.

The data must first be placed in the working directory and may be acquired here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

* `CodeBook.md` contains a detailed description of the solution to this assessment.

* The `_analysis.R` file contains the code to collect the smartphone data and produce two `.txt` files containing summarised data. Note that the `data.7z` file must be extracted first.
